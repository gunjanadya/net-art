  <h1>Fake Student IG</h1>
  <p>Instagram, a widely used photo-sharing app, plays a significant role 
    in shaping our social interactions by providing a platform for users to 
    share moments of their lives through images. However, its impact raises 
    questions about authenticity due to the ease with which fabricated 
    content can be disseminated. To explore this, I conducted an 
    intervention by creating a fake profile of a Rutgers student named 
    "Brianna" using images sourced exclusively from Pinterest. From Friday, 
    March 8th, to Sunday, March 10th, I followed numerous Rutgers students 
    with the aim of assessing their interactions with the fake profile. 
    Surprisingly, some private accounts, which require owner approval for 
    follow requests, accepted the request, indicating a level of perceived 
    authenticity and trust. This acceptance suggests that users may have 
    genuinely believed the fake profile represented someone they knew or 
    had encountered, underscoring the potential for deception and 
    manipulation on social media platforms like Instagram. This analysis 
    highlights the need for users to approach online interactions with 
    caution and critical thinking. With more time, I would continue this 
    intervention by interacting with some of these users to see if I could
    get them to reveal more personal information to my fake account. A 
    screeenshot of my intervention is shown below:</p>
