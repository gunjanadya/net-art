    <p>
        Welcome to this interactive and collabotative net art exhibition, where the 
        boundaries between creator and audience blur into a collaborative symphony of 
        digital expression. Unlike traditional art forms, here, interaction is not 
        just encouragedâ€”it's essential. Each artwork beckons you to click, swipe, 
        and engage, inviting you to become an active participant in its creation. 
        Check out Exhausting a Crowd, and add in your own notes about what people in 
        the crowd may be thinking or doing, which will then be added into the existing 
        tapestry. Or perhaps you will contribute by destroying, with Tokenize This, 
        where each click creates a link that can only be viewed once before being 
        destroyed forever. Whatever you choose, know that you will not be a passive 
        viewer, but rather an active architect in the creation of these net art 
        projects.

                r/place was a collaborative art project hosted on Reddit in April 2017, 
                and continued on annually after that. It consists of a large, blank 
                canvas where users can place a single colored pixel every few minutes. 
                The canvas is divided into a grid, and users can create, modify, or 
                destroy pixel art in real-time. The project attracts millions of users 
                who create intricate artworks, fight for control over certain areas, 
                and collaborate to create larger designs. r/place demonstrates the 
                power of online communities to create and organize complex projects in 
                real-time. Can you spot the Rutgers "R" in last year's canvas?

            <p>
                Exhausting a Crowd presents footage from seven major cities and allows 
                users to add moving captions to this footage. These captions are added 
                into the site as a whole so that they are viewable by all users. This
                adds dimentionality to these videos, as captions are often tracking 
                particular peoople in the crowd and assigning them thoguhts, feelings, 
                and words. In this way, the online crowd creates an interesting and 
                realistic crowd in person in these clips. What do you think they're 
                thinking in there?

            <a href="https://tokenizethis.link/" target="_blank"><h2>Tokenize This</h2></a>
            <p>
                Tokenize This was created as a response to the popularity of NFTs. Each 
                reload of the site creates a new peice of art, that cannot ever be 
                viewable again. This demonstrates the absurdity of creating false 
                scarcity over digital art. Furthermore, it demonstrates the fleeting 
                nature of internet art. The lack of physical space taken up by this art 
                means it can be infinite, but it also goes away the second we step away 
                from the screen. Would you like to make some of your own rare internet 
                art tokens?
